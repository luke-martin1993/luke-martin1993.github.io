            <h1>Personal Bio</h1>
            <p>Hello my name is Luke. I am studying online at RMIT Univeristy through OUA. I have been studying with RMIT since 2016. I graduated from Churchalnds Senior High School in 2010. I am currently working as a Kids Parkour Coach at a gym in Perth called Movementco. I have a beautiful Groodle called Freddy, his 3 years old and full of energy. My hobby and focus of my project is aquariums, aquaponics and hydroponics. I have in the past built a fully funcitoning aquaponics system in my shed. I used two aquariums that are plumbed together which are plubmed to a vertical grow tower. The system is currently out of action as I am now living in an apartment, when I move into a house in about 6 months I will get everything back up and running again. I have kept cichlids, more specificly I had a school of Red Zebras and I have also kept Barramundi.</p>

            <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        </div>
        <div class = "section-content" id = "section-two-content">
            <h1>What is your interest in IT?</h1>
            <p>My interest in IT started when I was about 10 years old. My grandparents were moving house and I was tasked with the job of packing up and setting up their computer. I had never done it before and I just went for it. Unplugging everything was no hard task but when it came to plugging everything back in I just matched up the cords with the colours and receiving heads on the motherboard and that was it. I had done it and I was so happy with myself. At a later date my grandparents upgraded their computer and gifted me their old one and that secured my interest in IT. I had my own computer. From about 16 years old, I realised I didn't really like working for people. I wanted to work for myself and I felt that IT was a great way to make that happen. I realised that I couldn't make a lot of money fixing computers and I needed to expand my skill set. Thats when I found OUA and RMIT and I haven't looked back. </p>
            <h1>Why did you choose RMIT?</h1>
            <p>I chose RMIT as I was able to study online through OUA at my own pace. The units provided looked very hands on with a lot of coding. That excited me. I really wanted to learn how to code. I had tried computer science at ECU and there was a lot of theory. It bored me. Like the other 6 degrees I started, I eventually stopped attending classes and failed. Throughout my university career, I have failed over 25 units at 4 different universities. RMIT was the first university where I actually passed units. </p>
            <h1>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1>
            <p>I expect to learn how computers work on a detailed level. To learn about computer security, networking, software engineering and then of course the coding aspect in multiple languages. I expect to learn best practises, project management and how to work well as apart of a team. Studying online also brings another aspect into play. I will learn how to manage my time, how to motivate myself and how to stay organised. Something that has proven very difficult to learn to this day.</p>

            <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
        </div>
        <div class = "section-content">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>For me in this section I will deviate from the assignment spec a little bit. My ideal job is not on seek. My ideal job is to be working for myself. Currently I am doing some free lance web development for a friend who is a graphic designer. I work with two friends, the graphic Designer, Boris and another developer, Marcus. I love working with my friends, I love working in my own time and I love the idea of making my own money. I also have a passion for gardening and horticulture and I would like to combine the IT side of things with my passion for growing food to build an autonomous system for growing food and perhaps when the time comes, Cannabis.</p>
            <h1>Current Skills</h1>
            <p>I currently have pretty basic skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery, PHP and SQL. I have also done a little bit of work with frameworks like bootstrap and UIKit. Every project we emabark on comes with learning curves and forces me to develop my skills a little bit further. I get a lot of satisfaction out of taking a design spec and building a web application that perfectly resembles that design spec in the most efficent way possible.</p>
            <h1>Skills to Develop</h1>
            <p>I need to keep working on  developing my current skills in the languages mentioned above. I think that CSS and Jquery in particular for my Web Development path. I also need to learn some server side languages, whether that be PHP or perhaps Node.JS. Over the last year of working with my friends we have noticed a growing market for Mobile Apps, I would like to develop my skills in that arena too. Swift for IOS apps and Java for Android Apps. It seems that Marketing and SEO comes pretty hand in hand with Web Development. Businesses don't just want a website, but they want SEO, Google Adwords and Facebook Ad Campaigns, they need hosting. So when looking at providing a complete digial solution I need to expand my skill set on a few plains. </p>
            <h1>Skill Development Plan</h1>
            <p>As stated above, with each new project comes an oppurtunity to learn more to keep up with the clients wants and needs. Right now I really want to finish my degree which will help me hone in a lot of my dev skills. I will be doing a C# unit soon which could be a good way to do backends for larger systems. Google has some great education programs for learning SEO and how to use GoogleAdWords, Lynda.com is a great resource to learn IOS and Andriod App development. A background in coding is a great resource to have when learning new languages. So through finishing my degree, doing some courses on Lynda.com and getting experience with doing jobs for clients I will develop my skills to a level where I can make my dreams a reality. </p>

            <h1>What do these results mean to me?</h1>
            <p>This is not the first time I have done such tests. It's a very good way of showing your flaws and showing what you need to work on. Me personally, I need to work on being more confident, more emotionally resiliant, more organised and more adaptable to change. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and Anxiety. I take no medication and try to regulate myself through CBT, exercise and keeping to a schedule. I try to learn about how I can improve all the time through audiobooks, podcasts, books and Jordan Peterson.</p>
            <h1>How do you think these reults may influence your behaviour within a team?</h1>
            <p>I think I work well within a team, I have good attention to detail, I am a perfectionist and I am very agreeable for good or for bad. I am very supportive and I encourage people I think I need to be better at taking criticisim, I need to speak up when I think there is a problem and generally be more confident and less passive agressive. I am constantly working on improving myself.</p>
            <h1>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
            <p>I think a good team should strive to have a balance across the board. A team needs a leader. One good strong leader. A team needs to have good, positive and honest communication. A team needs to have individuals who can carry their own weight. A team needs to be able to anaylse themselves and self correct and finally I think a good team needs to be adaptable. So I think it is good to take people who are industrious, people who will work hard, people who can be creative and adaptable, people who can envision a final product, people who speak the truth even if its going to hurt someone elses feelings and people who are emotionally stable and able to carry their own weight.</p>

            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        </div>
        <div class = "section-content">
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>My project idea involves using Arduino and various sensor probes to create an autonomous, scalable and modular aquarium/aquponics/hydroponics system. For the scope of this assignment I will focus on the aquarium/aquaponics as its where I have the most experience. Aquariums and Aquaponics systems can be quite volatile as it requires keeping water parameters within certain ranges of concentration. The parameters that are to be monitored are PH, O2, Nitrate, Nitrite, Ammonia and Ammonium. Within an aquarium there are bacteria that convert the toxic ammonia and ammonium into nitrates and nitrites which are nutrients for plants and non-toxic to the fish. This system revolves around the idea of adding fresh water to keep the toxic concentrations of ammonia and ammonium below a certain a level. Nitrates and Nitrates can become toxic at higher concentrations if they are not used by plants. As well as adding fresh water to keep the PH within a certain range, this depends on the fish but a general rule of thumb is around 7. Adding an automatic fish feeders is easy and can be bought on eBay for under $20. </p>
            <img src = "assets/fish_1.png">
            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p>As we as a civilization expand and grow so do our food requirements. Traditional farming and agriculture involves using 2D plots of land and huge amounts of water and fertilizer to yeild a harvestable and sellable product. This is simply not sustainable. As our poopulation grows, our food and water requirements grow, our requirements of land for housing grow too. Aquaponics offers a way of farming that uses 90% less water than conventional farming. It yields a product that is 100% organic using the excriment of the fish as fertilizer. We are able to utilise 3 dimensional structures to grow in. I personally created a cube that would allow me to grow 81 heads of lectuce in a space equeal to 0.5m^3 not including the aquarium space required for the fish. As currently the price of water is so cheap, aquaponics is considered an expensive way to grow food. As we continue to grow as a population our water prices will grow too. Its simple supply and demand. Aquaponics also has a relatively low startup capital required compared to farming which requires hectares of land, and expensive equipment such as tractors and irrigation. Each harvest strips the land of nutrients that took millions of years of decomposition to create. It is usually but not always replaced with artificial and toxic fertilizer that ends up in our water supply.</p>
            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>This project is scalable and modular, meaning a system of any size can be created and it can be made bigger or smaller with ease at a later date. This project will aim to create a system that produces 100% organic food to harvest while minimising the space required for the food to grow and the water and fertilizer required. It is a self contained system meaning that once everything has been setup nothing else needs to be added except fresh water to maintain the concentrations of the Ammonia and Ammonium. The system will need to have a line that connects it to a water supply through an electronic ball valve.</p>
            <p>Sensor probes will be used to detect the levels of Ammonia and Ammonium in the system, these sensor probes come Arduino compatible and will relay the information back to the Arduino system for processing. If the readings are above a certain range then an electronic ball valve will open for a predefined time allowing a certain amount of fresh water to enter the system which will reduce the overall concentration of ammonia and ammonium in the system maintaining a safe environment for the fish. The data will be logged via Arduino allowing the system to be further calibrated. If the ammonia and ammonium levels are consistently too high this means that there are not enough bacteria converting the ammonia and ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Further filter media can be added to the biological filtration system to increase the surface area for bacteria to breed on. Alternatively this may indicate that there are too many fish in the system for the bacteria to handle and if the bacteria numbers cannot be increased then fish may be subtracted from the system until a harmony is met where the fish are producing the correct amount of ammonia and ammonium for the bacteria to convert into nitrate and nitrite for the plants.</p>
            <p>As the sensor probes are expensive, one can be used in the beginning to provide a proof of concept. One single ammonia probe to detect the concentration of ammonia in the system. Once the single ammonia probe is working with the electronic ball valve consistently, more probes can be added to increase the complexity and accuracy of the system. The same process can be repeated for all additional probes that are to be added to the system.</p>

            <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
            <p>The tools that will be required to take the project from it current stage to final completion are as follows.</p>
            <div id = "container">
                <li>Vernier Ammonium Ion Selective Electrode</li>
                <li>Vernier Ammonia Ion Selective Electrode</li>
                <li>Vernier Nitrate Ion Selective Electrode</li>
                <li>Vernier Nitrite Ion Selective Electrode</li>
                <li>Go Direct Temperature Probe </li>
                <li>Go Direct PH Sensor</li>
                <li>Go Direct O2 Gas Sensor Probe</li>
                <li>Vernier Arduino Interface Shield</li>
                <li>SparkFun Arduino RedBoard</li>
                <li>Electronic Ball Valve</li>
            </div>
            <p>This is a list of hardware that will be required to take the project to COMPLETION. As this is a scalable and modular project it is possible to start with just one ammonia ion selective electrode, the interface sheild and the SparkFun Arduino RedBoard. This simple version of the system will stop the fish dying from ammonia spikes and be a great start to a fully autonomous system. </p>
            
            <p>The software will have to be written, there are various working versions that people have posted on GitHub but for the experience I would like to hand code everything myself. Arduino uses C++. A language I have little experience with, but can learn.</p>
            
            <h1>Skills Required</h1>
            <p>Arduino is written in C++. This is a language that I have little experience using. I would be relying on my previous Object Oriented coding knowledge in Java to help me learn the syntax but I am familar with the concepts. Eventually I would like to have a web application that dictates the current levels for all sensors with settings to control the tempreture and ability do manual water changes. A button that would open the electronic ball valve for a specific amount of time to add a certain amount of fresh water.</p>
            
            <h1>Outcome and Reflection</h1>
            <p>There is no getting away from the fact that this is a massive project that could take multiple years to complete but as it is modular and scalable its possible to start really small with even just a SparkFun Arduino Redboard and an electronic ball valve. Just getting the valve to open at the press of a button on a web application would be a great small and scalable project that would fit the scope of this unit. If the project could be completed in its entirety, it would change the way we grow food. It would merge my two passions, IT and Horticulture. I think its a great goal to have and a great project to have that I can work on for years to come. If technology like this became mainstream it would allow the individual to grow their own organic food in their own home autonomously. After the system is paid for and setup the only cost would be the seeds for the vegetables they wanted to grow and the cost of the fish to put in the system. It's form factor could be redesigned to something that resembles a filing cabinet. With the aquarium in the bottom and grow tubes on top. It could sit next to the fridge in the kitchen. Its possibilites are really endless, from being ontop of high rise buildings to be sitting in greenhouses around the metro area with drones on standby to deliver the produce to customers for a fee. It really could change the world. With water becoming more and more scarce everyday, this is the way we need to be going. We need to be looking at how the individual can get involved in helping the world fix its problems.</p>
